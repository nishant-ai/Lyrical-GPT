# 🎵 Lyrical-GPT

Lyrical-GPT is an AI-powered lyrics generator that creates song lyrics based on given prompts, styles, and emotions. Built using **GPT-based models**, this project fine-tunes AI to generate creative, coherent, and contextually relevant lyrics across different music genres.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 **Generate lyrics** based on prompts (e.g., mood, theme, or artist style).
- 🎶 **Fine-tuned on lyrical datasets** for improved musical creativity.
- 🎛️ **Customizable parameters** (temperature, max tokens, etc.) for varied creativity levels.
- 📜 **Supports multiple genres** (hip-hop, rock, pop, country, etc.).
- 🌐 **Web-based interface** for easy lyric generation.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishant-ai/Lyrical-GPT.git
   cd Lyrical-GPT
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
4. Set up API keys (if using OpenAI’s GPT):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

## 📌 Usage

Run the script to generate lyrics:
```bash
python generate_lyrics.py --prompt "love and heartbreak" --genre "pop"  
```

Or use the web UI:
```bash
streamlit run app.py  
```
